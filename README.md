# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

# About

This is a project for me to explore the workings of decentralized applications and how to build them on the Ethereum network. The Hardhat ecosystem seems like it provides some of the most comprehensive tools for developers, so I wanted to dive right in and start learning the steps associated with creating, testing, deploying, and using a smart contract developed using Hardhat.

*This project was started and created by following Hardhat's documentation and this excellent Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSL69RGeQL0 (thanks Travis!)*

The majority of the hardhat ecosystem is the same as Travis's code. It appears that there are some differences in testing plugins and the deployment, which now makes use of [hardhat ignition](https://hardhat.org/ignition/docs/getting-started#overview). The steps were followed as described in the documentation.
